Generate the v2 open-floor stage: assets/sets/stage_wide.png.

v1's bg_newsroom.png was a fixed 1920x1080 shot with a sit-down desk, sized for a
bust-shot crop. v2 needs full bodies, walking room for both anchors, and a screen
mount above each anchor's home mark — so the stage is a WIDE virtual canvas, much
bigger than the delivered 1920x1080 frame. tools/camera.py crops+scales a 16:9
window out of this at render time (the wide two-shot, or a push in on one anchor);
nothing about camera framing is baked into this art.

No desk/console this time (open floor, per the v2 set design decision) — the floor
grid runs to the bottom of frame, and the lower-third caption overlays the lower
legs, same as real broadcast lower-thirds.

Reuses the proven pieces from make_background.py (sky gradient, seeded skyline,
retrowave grid, vignette, and — importantly — the alpha_composite-layer discipline
that fixed v1's blending bug: draw anything with alpha<255 on its own transparent
layer, then Image.alpha_composite it onto the canvas; drawing translucent shapes
directly on a live RGBA canvas doesn't blend in Pillow, it just overwrites).

# each anchor owning an isolated monitor at the far edge of the stage. Verified
# clear of overlap against CHAR_DISPLAY_W (camera.py) at these marks: each
# anchor's own body box, the shared screen box, and the *other* anchor's body box
# all have a real gap between them (no forced overlap at rest).

# Shared screen bezel mount — ONE display centered between both anchors' marks,
# not one per anchor. This is the core v3 fix: the old layout (a screen at each
# far edge of the stage) meant a camera favoring either anchor could only ever
# show that anchor's own screen, and the two screens never appeared together —
# there was no such thing as "the shared screen" in the old geometry, just two
# unrelated monitors. Centering one screen between the marks means camera.py's
# per-anchor close shot (favor Nate / favor Kai) both naturally include the same
# screen in frame, satisfying the "camera cuts between anchors, screen stays in
# shot" requirement without needing a new camera concept — see camera.py.
# Kept at head/shoulder height (v2.2's fix, still correct) so the close single-cam
# crop stays a tight medium shot instead of zooming out for a screen mounted high.
# v4: bumped up from 820x500 — on a wide two-shot the old size read as a small
# distant plaque, not a display anyone could actually read the chart/graphic
# on. Checked against NATE_MARK_X/KAI_MARK_X + CHAR_DISPLAY_W (camera.py) at
# this width: still clears both anchors' body boxes at rest with a small
# margin, so it doesn't visually stack on top of either of them.
