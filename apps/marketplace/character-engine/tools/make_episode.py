"""
tools/make_episode.py — runs pipeline stages 3-7 (VOICE, SYNC, RENDER, ASSEMBLE,
SCORE) for a given episode.json end to end.

Usage:
    python3 tools/make_episode.py episodes/ep001-ai-math-conjecture/episode.json

v2 RENDER stage: full-body anchors posed by tools/rig_pose.py's FK engine (walking,
gestures, idle sway) standing on the wide open-floor set (tools/make_stage.py), each
with their own content screen (tools/screen_graphics.py) showing the fact behind a
cited line. tools/camera.py crops/scales a 1920x1080 window out of that wide stage —
a two-shot for cited lines (so the point-at-screen gesture and the screen both read),
a push in on whoever's speaking otherwise — replacing v1's dim/desaturate trick with
an actual camera cut (with a quick simulated push, not a hard cut).

VOICE (synth_line), SYNC (rhubarb_sync), and SCORE (ensure_audio_assets, mix_in_ding,
score_episode) are unchanged from v1 — nothing about audio changed in v2.

    was framed (see the geometry note in the v5 changelog): the screen sits at
    head height between two marks 1800px apart, so any wide two-shot at this
    aspect ratio reaches that band regardless of what's in the bbox union.
    Giving the outro its own backdrop sidesteps that geometry entirely, lets
